# Neuromorphic Experiments – Documentation Index

Welcome to the neuromorphic experiments documentation. This folder captures the research intent, architecture, methods, and progress for the neuromorphic branch of Moshi.

The production app must not depend on any of this code; everything here is for research and exploration only.

## Documents

- WHITEPAPER.md — Concept and architecture of “Neural Packets,” QoS-as-synapses, gamma binding, and the overall system design.
- RESEARCH_NOTES.md — Running lab notes: parameters, settings, and observations as we iterate.
- PROGRESS_REPORT.md — What we attempted and what we’ve accomplished so far.
- HOW_TO_RUN.md — How to run demos and tests for the experiments.
- ROADMAP.md — Near-term plans, open questions, and risk items.

Related docs in this repository:
- experiments/neuromorphic/research/README.md — A narrative overview of the experiment and scientific basis.
- Project root docs (e.g., README.md, PLAN.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md) — Broader integration and app-level planning.

## Scope

This documentation set focuses on:
- The Neuromorphic research modules (research/)
- The experimental consciousness layer (models/)
- Demos/UI for inspection (ui/) and tests (tests/)

If you’re looking for production architecture or user-facing features, refer to top-level documents and backend libraries under `next-server/backend/`.
