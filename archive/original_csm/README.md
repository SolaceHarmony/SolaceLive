# Original CSM Snapshot

This directory contains the untouched Sesame CSM reference implementation that inspired the current adapter. It stays out of the production workspace so that the MLX backend remains TypeScript-first.

Use it only for historical reference or when testing the GGUF/Ollama integration scripts.
