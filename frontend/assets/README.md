# Frontend Assets

- `demo/` — legacy image assets used in the original UI mock-ups. They are staged here until the new frontend reintroduces them (if at all).
- `audio-test.html` — old browser audio harness; keep for debugging only.

These assets are no longer part of the active Next.js build; move back into `next-server/public/` when the new UI requires them.
