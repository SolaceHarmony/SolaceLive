# Frontend Components (Staged)

Previously these lived under `lib/unified/components`. They are parked here until the Next.js UI is restored.

- `ErrorBoundary.tsx`
- `PacketStreamingVoiceInterface.tsx` (placeholder in need of rebuild)
- `WhisperXDemo.tsx`
- `VoiceInterface.module.css`

When reactivating the UI, import these from `frontend/components/` or move them back under `next-server/` after theyâ€™re modernised.
